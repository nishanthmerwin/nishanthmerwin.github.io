# My Portfolio and Resume

The resume was created with json resumes (mostly), but decided to integrate some of the themes from the "slick" theme into my portfolio page as well.

### Next steps

- Change the domain name.

- Test for mobile / switch to responsive templates in home and portfolio

- Update however I need to.
